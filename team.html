        <h1>Meet the team</h1>
        <p>It takes a strong team of developers to complete a project such as this one. Our goal is to find the best of the best, motivated people from all around the world.</p>
        <h2>Developers</h2>
    <div id="devs">
        <div id="casper" class="dev">
            <h1 onclick="casperSound()">Casper<img src="assets/devs/casper.jpg" class="devpfp"></h1>
            <h3 class="nickname">Owner</h3>
            <p class="quote">"That's a problem for later"</p>
            <p>Casper loves solving tough problems, science and maths, and programming. Before working on ABTTP, Casper was busy recreating (parts of) other games and creating videos about those projects. His favorite food is the fabled pancake, he even named his main channel after it!</p>
            <p>Casper owns the project together with Reevz. Besides that, his main task is programming every aspect of the game. Most of this is done through Minecraft datapacks and commands, as well as resource packs.</p>

        <div id="reevz" class="dev">
            <h1 onclick="reevzSound()">Reevz<img src="assets/devs/reevz.png" class="devpfp"></h1>
            <h3 class="nickname">Owner</h3>
            <p class="quote">"ALTTP is my childhood"</p>
            <p>Reevz loves music and expressing his creativity through his projects. Before working on ABTTP, Reevz made memes on his YouTube channel.</p>
            <p>Reevz owns the project together with Casper. He's most busy with building, modeling, and designing. For this he uses many external tools such as Blockbench and WorldPainter. He approached Casper with the recreation idea at the end of 2021, and the rest is history!</p>

        <div id="finn" class="dev">
            <h1 onclick="finnSound()">Finn<img src="assets/devs/finn.png" class="devpfp"></h1>
            <h3 class="nickname">Models</h3>
            <p class="quote">"Subscribe or I invade your country"</p>
            <p>Finn is a german boy at the age of 17. He is not very patriotic (because he is german and the last 100 years of german history aren't that flattering), but is still always up to make jokes about France and Belgium. In the team of A block to the Past, it's his and Reevz's responsibility to create the models for this wonderful recreation of a cult classic. Now and then Reevz will also ask him and the rest of the crew for their opinion on his builds. All in all, Finn is a jolly guy who loves participating in this wonderful project and he can't wait for you to be able to play this masterpiece yourself.</p>
            <p>Finn joined the project at the start of 2023. He's a magnificent builder and modeler, who helps speed up both processes. Finn proposed to join the project himself.</p>
