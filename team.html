        <h1>Meet the team</h1>
        <p>It takes a strong team of developers to complete a project such as this one. Our goal is to find the best of the best, motivated people from all around the world.</p>
        <h2>Developers</h2>

            <p class="quote">"That's a problem for later"</p>
            <p>Casper loves solving tough problems, science and maths, and programming. Before working on ABTTP, Casper was busy recreating (parts of) other games and creating videos about those projects. His favorite food is the fabled <span id="secretWord" onclick="secret()">pancake</span>, he even named his main channel after it!</p>
            <p>Casper owns the project together with Reevz. Besides that, his main task is programming every aspect of the game. Most of this is done through Minecraft datapacks and commands, as well as resource packs.</p>
