        <h2>What is A Block to the Past?</h2>
        <p>We're recreating all - and more - of <i>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</i> inside of (Vanilla) Minecraft. This includes the overworld, dark world, every dungeon, enemy, item, and boss. When finished, the entire map will be available for free for everyone to play. We're also aiming to add even more content than there already was. This means new items, new enemies, new bosses, new dungeons, and even completely new features.</p>
        <h2>When will this project be finished?</h2>
        <p>This is a difficult question to answer. All of us are young people who have lots of other stuff to be busy with, but we try to focus a lot of our free time on this recreation. That being said, I cannot give you a release date or window just yet. It will most likely take a few more years for the project to be complete. You can always check our progress <a href="progress.html">here</a>.</p>
        <h2>What new content are you adding?</h2>
        <p>As mentioned before, the new content includes many things. First are the new items, enemies, dungeons, and bosses. Most of these will be inspired or ported from other Zelda games, especially the enemies. We don't want to flood the game with too many enemies or items, however, so we're trying to choose only the most interesting ones. New bosses and dungeons are a much larger task, so they will have to wait until far into development - perhaps if the main game is finished. Other new features include a colosseum with rounds of boss/enemy trials to fight your way through, many new quests, a bestiary, and so much more.</p>
